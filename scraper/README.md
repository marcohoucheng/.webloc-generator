# Web Scraper

The goal of this script is to create a method to download all reports available for the course [CS231n: Deep Learning for Computer Vision](http://cs231n.stanford.edu) at Stanford University.

The projects are submitted by students of the modules enrolled from 2015 to 2017. The reports can be found on [cs231n.stanford.edu/project.html](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/project.html).

This script uses `BeautifulSoup4` and `selenium` libraries for Python.
